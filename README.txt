This converter only generates the .cues file for any difficulty.
For the rest of the files including the .mogg and .mid, I would recommend
the Audica file generator by Alternity.
Make sure all of the parameters are filled out (I don't run file safety checks).
Also make sure both filepaths don't end in slashes and that the .osu file ends
with .osu.
Because this converter does not use the .ogg file, you will need to enter the 
song bpm manually. You can find the bpm online or use www.audiokeychain.com 
to calculate it for you.
You'll also need to change your song.desc file to include this bpm.

Because Osu! does not put any start time restrictions on its songs, if a song
does not have an empty intro, you'll have to manually add some empty time
at the front of the audio file using a program like Audacity. Add a second or two
to the start of the audio file and, using the converter, enter the exact offset
you added in milliseconds. This will line up the Osu! map to the new audio file.

There are also a few settings to change how sliders and hand changes are
interpreted. Feel free to select the option you feel most comfortable with for
playing or editing.
